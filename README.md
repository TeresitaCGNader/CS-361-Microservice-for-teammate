# CS-361-Microservice-for-teammate


This program is using ZeroMQ, you will need to install pyzmq

See: https://zeromq.org/languages/python/

<b>How to request data from this microservice?</b>

<p>1- You will need two terminals, one for the client and one for the server</p>
<p>2- cd the directory where the program is located</br>
(example: cd OneDrive\Documentos\GitHub\CS-361-Microservice-for-teammate)</p>
<p>3- In one terminal run the server using "python server.py"</p>
<p>4- In another terminal run the client using "python client.py"</p>
<p>The client sends a request to the server and the server will respond sending data. Right now both the client and server have the same placeholder code, so you can implement your individual project in either the client or server.</p>
